# This file shows how to specify the parameters for generating
# synthetic data for clustering. Edit according to your needs.

# In this parameter file, 'cluster' is a keyword that is
# used to separate the parameters for the different
# clusters. What follows this keyword is the mean vector
# for the cluster.  After that, we have a blank line before
# the covariance matrix.  The dimensionality of covariance
# matrix must be the same as as that of the mean vector.
# Additionally, the covariance matrix is expected to be
# positive definite.  If it is not, you will hear from the
# Math::Random module that is used to actually generate the
# multivariate random numbers for the different clusters.

# The example here is for clustering in 3D space.  But note
# there are no constraints on the dimensionality of the
# space in which you cluster as long as it is at least 2.
# The dimensionality is set by the number of elements in the
# first mean vector.
